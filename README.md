##Concept
The Scrum DAO it&#39;s an attempt to combine flexible software development methodology (Scrum) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).

We also want to offer a new approach to ICO to prevent over-inflating budget and greater involvement of investors in the development process. The idea is very simple - emit new tokens when some portion of work has been done and approved.

##Integrations
In our plans do integration with most popular project management systems, eg JIRA, Github. In our projects we use JIRA and very like it, so we started with it. 

##Main Scenario
- Project Owner deploys contracts and adds Workers.
- When Issue created TrustedOracle(not Owner) push new votings to ProductBacklog and PlanningPoker Contracts.
- Any token Holders can vote for issue's priority in the ProductBacklog.
- Workers play in a PlanningPoker and vote for issue's story points.
- When Issue closed Worker get an award which depends on issue's story points.
- Worker put sell order in the Crowdsale contract.
- Investor pays ETH to buy Tokens.
- Investor now can vote to issue's priority and expect part of a future company's profits.
